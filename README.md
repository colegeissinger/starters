Starters - WordPress Starter Theme for Web Developers
========

<strong>Currently under heave development!! The repo should be filled by the end of the year with the first beta copy of the starter theme.</strong>


Starter WordPress Theme for Developers
--------

Built as a starter theme with rapid prototyping. Starters is built to give you ultimate control of your theme and give the option of over 10 prebuilt layouts and styles to speed up your development time. Using <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> as the primary fluid grid system, we bake in it's features bringing the power of this great front-end framework to an easily manageable starter theme for WordPress. But wait, there's more! We also brought in some of the awesome features of the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> to give your Wordpress install that extra ompf!

Built on SASS &amp; Compass
----------

In today's web industry, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> &amp; <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> is the bee's knees. We baked in all that goodness right into the core of Starters. To harness the power of SASS &amp; Compass we are using the SASS fluid grid system of Foundation to power our layouts to increase production time. Out of the box Foundation is phenomenal, however, we simplified things a little further by providing optional custom styles to reduce the load of classes if you wish to go that route.
